Overview:

Plantimer is an IoT solution that uses soil moisture and water-level sensors along with an ESP32-based automation logic to manage plant conditions in real time.

This simple, sensor-based project was created to provide the following features:

Automatic watering based on soil moisture readings from a soil moisture sensor module

Reservoir level detection using a water-level sensor to monitor remaining water supply

Emoji status summary displayed on an OLED screen to convey the plant’s current condition

Growth photo logging with an ESP32-CAM to record daily plant images

Use Cases:

Busy urban dwellers: Worry-free plant care even when you’re away from home

Office green decor: Low-maintenance greenery for workspaces

Seniors & mobility-impaired users: Healthy indoor environment support via automated alerts
